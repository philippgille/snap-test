# There currently seem to be several issues with cross compiling a snap with the go plugin.
# Without this, and without "--target-arch=...", the snap will be built for the same arch the build is running on.
# In the future we should check for updates of snapcraft and revisit this option.

base: core18

grade: stable # devel or stable. devel can't be published to the candidate or stable channels.
confinement: strict # devmode or strict. devmode snaps can't be published to the stable channel. strict leads to no access outside of declared interfaces through plugs.

parts:
  serve:
    # Go plugin source code: https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/snapcraft/plugins/go.py
    plugin: go
    # Set go-channel to an empty string so that the Go plugin doesn't use the unofficial Go snap for building.
    # We want to use the OS's package manager's Go package.
    # When using a recent version of snapcraft, building a snap is done in a VM which is currently Ubuntu 18.04,
    # so even when using an older Ubuntu 16 as host, at least Go 1.10 is used.

    # Using the repository instead of "." makes it possible to use this file standalone
    # and also leads to reproducable builds thanks to the tag (in case it's used instead of a source-depth of 1).
